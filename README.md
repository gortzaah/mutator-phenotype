# mutator-phenotype

Welcome! This webpage contains the code to support the publication _"The multifaced impact of the mutator phenotype during the evolution of cancer treatment resistance"_ (or something like that; we haven't decided on the title yet). 

The code consists of two parts: 
* The **ABM** code: a Java code used to generate the data. Requires [HAL - Hybrid Automata Library](https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL)
* The **Analysis** code: a Python code (*hopefully* written soon as Jupyter notebook) used to analyze the ABM output

Cheers, 

*Gortzaah ov Doom*
